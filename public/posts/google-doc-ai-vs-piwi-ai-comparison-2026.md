## Two Intelligent Platforms, Two Different Outcomes

When businesses decide to automate document processing in 2026, Google Document AI is often one of the first names they explore. It's powered by Google's machine learning and delivers strong data extraction.

But there's a fundamental difference between the two: **Google Document AI gives you extracted data. Piwi.ai gives you finished, usable documents.**

> **Google Document AI stops at extraction. Piwi.ai closes the loop by using that intelligence to produce the final output your business actually needs.**

Both platforms are intelligent. Google processes information with AI; so does Piwi.ai. The difference is what each platform does with that intelligence. Google returns raw data in a JSON format and leaves the rest to you. Piwi.ai applies that same semantic intelligence to cross-validate your sources, map data into your document templates, and deliver a polished, signature-ready PDF - without a single line of code.

In this comparison, we'll break down which platform is right for your business.

## What Google Document AI Actually Is

Google Document AI is a powerful API that provides pre-trained models (like invoice parsers) and custom processors to extract structured data from unstructured documents. For engineering teams building document pipelines, it's a great engine.

However, because it is an API, it requires significant technical work to become useful to a business:

1.  Build an architecture to upload and route documents to the API.
2.  Write code to handle and parse the JSON responses it returns.
3.  Build a user interface so non-technical staff can review and work with the results.
4.  Write integration scripts to move that data into its final destination—a contract, a CRM record, a finalized PDF.

This is significant custom software development work that adds time, cost, and ongoing maintenance to your document automation project.

## How Piwi.ai Completes What Extraction Starts

[Piwi.ai](https://piwi.ai) is an intelligent document automation platform built for business teams. It doesn't just extract data - it understands it, validates it, and uses it to generate completed documents.

**Intelligent, Not Just Automated:** Piwi.ai's AI agents don't only read text off a page. They understand the *meaning* and *context* of the information across all your source files. When you upload a passport, a utility bill, and a lease template, Piwi.ai understands what each document contains and what to do with that information.

**Cross-Document Validation:** Before generating any output, Piwi.ai checks data consistency across your source files - confirming, for example, that the name on the ID matches the name on the bill, and flagging any discrepancy before it becomes your problem.

**Finished Documents, Not Raw Data:** The final output isn't a JSON file full of strings. It's a completed, formatted PDF - your contract, your onboarding packet, your deed - ready to review and sign.

## Side-by-Side Comparison

| Feature | Piwi.ai | Google Document AI |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Target Audience** | Business Operations, Admin Teams | Software Developers, Data Scientists |
| **Setup Time** | Minutes (True No-Code) | Weeks to Months (Requires Coding) |
| **User Interface** | Included (Web Dashboard) | Must be custom built |
| **Output Type** | Finished, Formatted PDFs | Raw JSON Data |
| **Cross-Document Validation** | ✅ Built-in AI intelligence | ❌ Requires custom scripting |
| **Template Mapping** | ✅ Automatic semantic mapping | ❌ Must build the integration |

## Pricing

**Google Document AI Pricing:** Google charges per-page based on the processor type (typically $10 to $65 per 1,000 pages for standard models). However, the total cost must include the engineering time required to build, host, and maintain the application on top of the API.

**Piwi.ai Pricing:** Piwi.ai offers transparent, all-in pricing with no implementation costs. The **Starter** plan is pay-as-you-go at **€0.20/page**. The **Business** tier scales with your volume with discounts down to **€0.05/page**. You can start with 100 free credits - no credit card needed.

## The Bottom Line

If you have a software engineering team and need a headless data extraction engine to embed inside a larger product, Google Document AI is a strong choice.

If you are a law firm, a real estate agency, an accounting practice, or any business whose goal is to stop typing data from documents into forms and contracts, you need a platform that handles the entire process intelligently - from extraction to the polished, finished output.

## FAQs

**Q: Is Piwi.ai intelligent, or does it just rely on external APIs like Google's?**
Piwi.ai uses its own generative AI agents to understand, validate, and process your documents. It does not just wrap another provider's extraction output - it applies contextual intelligence to produce a complete result.

**Q: Can non-technical staff really use Piwi.ai without training?**
Yes. If your team can drag and drop a file in a web browser, they can run complex document automation workflows in Piwi.ai.

**Q: Will we outgrow Piwi.ai at enterprise scale?**
No. Piwi.ai offers Enterprise tiers with custom SLAs, dedicated security, and volume pricing designed for high-scale deployments.
