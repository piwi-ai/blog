## Considering other options besides Nanonets?

Piwi.ai is an intelligent document automation platform that goes beyond simple extraction. We don't just read your documents, we map extracted data directly into your templates, validate it across multiple sources, and produce finished, signature-ready PDFs. No copy-pasting, no manual formatting, no developer required.

## What Piwi.ai Does Differently

**Intelligent Mapping, not just extraction.** Piwi.ai understands that a Passport Number and an ID Number are different data points even when they look identical on the page. It maps each field directly into the correct position in your template: right font, right size, right spot.

**Finished documents in minutes.** Upload a passport and a deed, select your contract template, download a completed PDF. What takes 15-20 minutes of manual work takes under 2 with Piwi.ai.

**Cross-document validation.** Before any output is generated, Piwi.ai checks data consistency across all your source documents. If the name on a passport doesn't match the utility bill, the system flags it before you send anything out.

**98% accuracy on complex documents.** Not on clean invoices, on the hard stuff: identity documents from multiple countries, property deeds with nested legal descriptions, photographed and handwritten documents.

**No technical setup.** No ML models to train, no API integrations to build, no developer needed. Upload your documents, pick a template, get a result. Built for real estate agents, legal assistants, and finance teams who need to move fast.

## Pricing That Scales With You

At Piwi.ai, we offer a flexible pricing strategy tailored to your requirements. Choose from a **Starter** plan at €0.20/page for small volumes and pilot programs, a **Business** plan with volume discounts that scale as you grow (down to €0.05/page for 30,000+ pages), or an **Enterprise** plan with custom pricing and dedicated support. Unlike Nanonets' pricing model of 30 cents per page, our value-driven approach ensures you only pay for what you use, and your cost per page decreases as your volume increases. Both Starter and Business plans include a free 14-day trial.

## The Bottom Line

If you need raw data extraction, Nanonets does the job. If you need finished, validated documents ready for signature, without touching the data yourself, that's what Piwi.ai is built for.
