## Thinking an Enterprise Solution is the Only Option?

ABBYY FlexiCapture is a powerhouse in the intelligent document processing world. It's built for massive enterprises processing millions of pages, requiring dedicated IT teams to manage complex infrastructure. But if you're a small to medium business—like a real estate agency, a boutique law firm, or a growing accounting practice—enterprise software often means paying for complexity you don't need.

[Piwi.ai](https://piwi.ai) is the ABBYY alternative for small businesses. We provide the same high-accuracy document intelligence without the enterprise price tag, the deployment headaches, or the need for a dedicated engineering team.

## Why Small Businesses Struggle with Enterprise IDP

When small businesses try to implement enterprise platforms like ABBYY, they usually run into three major roadblocks:

**1. The Implementation Nightmare.** Deploying ABBYY FlexiCapture isn't a weekend project. It often involves long consulting engagements, complex server configurations (for on-premise), and extensive training to build custom extraction models. Small teams simply don't have the IT resources to manage this.

**2. The Usability Gap.** Enterprise tools are built for developers and data scientists. Creating a new document template or adjusting an extraction rule requires technical expertise. If your office manager can't intuitively figure out how to upload a new contract format, the tool becomes a bottleneck rather than a solution.

**3. The Enterprise Price Tag.** With minimum volume commitments, heavy setup fees, and expensive annual licenses, enterprise IDP platforms can easily cost tens of thousands of dollars before you've successfully automated a single document.

## How Piwi.ai Replaces the Enterprise Overhead

Piwi.ai was built specifically to strip away the complexity of document automation, providing enterprise-grade accuracy in a true no-code environment.

**Intelligent Mapping, Zero Setup.** While enterprise tools require you to train models on where to look for data, Piwi.ai uses semantic AI to understand the document instantly. It knows the difference between a "Buyer Name" and a "Seller Name" on a contract without you writing a single rule. It extracts the data and maps it directly into your finalized PDF templates automatically.

**Ready in Minutes, Not Months.** There are no deployment cycles with Piwi.ai. You create an account, upload your source documents (like an ID and a deed), choose your output template, and download the finished, signature-ready document. What takes an implementation team to build in ABBYY takes your office manager an afternoon to start using in Piwi.ai.

**Focus on Finished Documents.** Most enterprise OCR stops at extracting raw data, leaving your team to figure out how to get that data into a usable format. Piwi.ai handles the full lifecycle: from unstructured input to a perfectly formatted, cross-validated final PDF.

## Pricing That Makes Sense for SMBs

Enterprise tools hide their pricing behind "Contact Sales" buttons because they are preparing to pitch you a massive annual contract.

At Piwi.ai, our pricing is transparent and designed to scale with your actual growth. You can start with our **Starter** plan at just €0.20/page, perfect for testing workflows or handling smaller volumes. As your business scales, our **Business** tier offers volume discounts dropping as low as €0.05/page. There are no surprise implementation fees, no mandatory consulting hours, and no paying for millions of pages you don't process. 

You only pay for what you use, and you can try it all with a free 14-day trial.

## The Bottom Line

If you are a Fortune 500 bank processing ten million varied documents a month with a dedicated IT department, an enterprise solution like ABBYY makes sense. 

If you are a growing business that just wants to stop manually typing data from passports into real estate contracts, you don't need enterprise complexity. You need a tool that works out of the box.

No. Piwi.ai achieves 98%+ accuracy on complex, unstructured documents (like photographed IDs and messy deeds) using modern generative AI agents, bypassing the need for the rigid template-training required by older enterprise OCR systems.

**Q: Can non-technical staff really use Piwi.ai?**
Absolutely. If your team can use a web browser to upload a file and click a button, they can automate documents with Piwi.ai. There is zero coding required.

**Q: Does Piwi.ai integrate with our existing software?**
Yes. Piwi.ai offers intuitive workflow automation and standard API integrations to connect with the tools you already use, without needing an engineering degree to set up.
